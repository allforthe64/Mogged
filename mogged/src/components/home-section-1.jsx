            <p className="spacer-4 mogged-text white">In the first age, in the first time of strife, a lone Spartan warrior
            wandered the land. He trained his body and his soul, fighting in battles for glory, <b className="acid">ONE MAN AGAINST AN ARMY. </b>
            This man was fabled not only for his fighting ability and dank suit of Spartan armor, but also for his perfectly
            symetrical and aesthetic physique. Said to glisten in the sun like a perfectly cut diamond, the Spartan's physique
            became so impressive that he could conquer entire nations by simply <b className="acid">SPREADING HIS LATS. </b>The
            Spartan soon became so jacked that he asceneded to god-hood and created a palace in the heavens, which he named <b className="acid">MOUNT SWOLYMPUS. </b>
            To him, he gathered the swollest in all the lands and trained them into an elite guard, which he named the <b className="acid">THE CHAMPIONS OF SWOLYMPUS</b></p>

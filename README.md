<h1>Lifting Heavy Weights and Writing Lightweight Code</h1>
<br>
I am a huge gym rat. Something about going to the gym, racking up an absurd ammount of weight and trying to lift it speaks to me. But one thing I 
don't enjoy, is writing complex, heavy code. So I decided to learn ReactJS :p. I knew going in that React would allow me to write lighter, easier to read code and I had a brilliant idea: why not use the power of lightweight code to build a website about jacking heavy weights? And just like that, the Mogged
Supplement Company was born. Read on to see how I combined two of my passions into one epic project:

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<br>

**Tech Used:** Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, ReactJS
<br>
<p>I started by building out prototypes in Adobe XD. This project was very brand focus, so I made sure to make each page convey the image and message
of the company. I also kept my target audience at the forefront of my thoughts, making sure the pages had the boldness and over the top styling I was 
looking for.</p>
<br>
<p>Since I was using this project as a functional way to flex my new React skills, I wanted to make sure I had a variety of diverse features. Mogged is built using exclusively functional components which I really enjoyed writing. Having the ability to write Javascript code and markup in the same file was a huge advantage gained over regular HTML/Javascript. I also wanted to take advantage of React's ability to easily implement single page web design to help speed up load times and simplify the building process. I hooked up all my pages using the react-router-dom library.</p>
<br>
<p>To build the shop and shopping cart pages, I again took advantage of React's blend of Javascript and markup. Using map methods, I dynamically generated components based on information stored in JSON finals. This is also how I created the three main product cards on the Mogged homepage.</p>
<br>
<p>And finally, I created a checkout system for the site using the PayPal developer API. All of 
code was taken from the PayPal website. This is to ensure that the code was secured and none of the 
users' personal information could be leaked.</p>
<br>
<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<br>
<p>One area I could definitely improve is the language translation system. Beyond a certain point it no longer becomes feasible to continue copying over text as I introduce languages. A better solution would be to dynamically load the text or elemnts and inject them into the page dynamically using JavaScript. But for right now, the system is simple and works, so until necessary I'm going to leave it as is.</p>
<br>
<h1>Lessons I Learned</h1>
<br>
<p>One of the big things this project taught me was the value of planning ahead. If I hadn't taken the time to communicate with the client, I probably would have spent a huge ammount of time and effort making small design changes that would have bogged down the design process.</p>
<br>
<p>I also learned how important it is to know how to find resources for what you're working on. Since I was working on this project alone, my Googling skills were really put to the test everytime I ran into an obstacle.</p>
